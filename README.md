This is a repository for code for competitive programming such as AtCoder and LeetCode.

## Explanation of the directory structure

### AtCoder
- Directory named `ABCxxx` is for AtCoder Beginner Contest xxx.
- Directory named `ARCxxx` is for AtCoder Regular Contest xxx.
- Directory named `ADT_yyyy_mmdd_time_E/M/H` is for AtCoder Daily Training Easy (xxx represents the data and start time of the contest).
	- `yyyy` is the year of the contest (e.g. 2024).
	- `mmdd` is the month and day of the contest (e.g. 0513).
